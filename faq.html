          <div class="waves-effect collapsible-header active"><i class="material-icons">question_answer</i>What's up with this FAQ?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body"><span>I get asked a lot of questions about the box models, and they're all very difficult to answer through my usual extreme nodding and wild gesturing. This FAQ is my solution to answering common questions.<br>You can click any question to open the relevant answer. There's a lot here, and I certainly don't expect you to read all of it; I do ask that you read the first three questions, though, as these clear up a common issue. All the questions are ordered in order of how important I think they are to answer.<br>Sorry if you encounter any issues with this panel or how it looks and works; I put this whole thing together in, like, an hour, so there's bound to be some issues. I'm working on improving it as time goes on, but how VRChat web panels is largely undocumented, so I'm basically guessing with each iteration.</span></div>

          <div class="waves-effect collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">phone_in_talk</i>Do you talk?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Yes! Not as the box avatars, though. I personally think that those are best mute, and to talk in them would "ruin the magic", like seeing a mascot take off their costume's head at Disneyland. I'm not your boss, though, so feel free to talk in any of the other box avatars!</span></div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="waves-effect collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">copyright</i>Did you make these?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Kind of! I didn't make the models themselves, but I configured them for VRChat, optimized them, and set up all of the animations and such. If you're interested in downloading them yourself, you can find them at: <a href="http://aidn.jp/mmd" target="_blank">aidn.jp/mmd</a></span></div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="waves-effect collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">error</i>You told me you made these!</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Really, really sorry about that! It's hard to convey that I uploaded them (but didn't make the mesh itself) just using hand gestures-- <i>especially</i> considering the model hasn't got fingers. One of the main reasons I bring people to this world is so that I can clear up this misconception, because I feel really, really bad taking credit for something I didn't do, even accidentally. I am genuinely really sorry if you thought I made these myself; I don't mean to mislead people, but this misconception is really easily formed and very hard to fix when you can't speak and people ask.</span></div>

        <li>
          <div class="waves-effect collapsible-header active"><i class="material-icons">face</i>How do I use the box models?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body"><span>The box avatars come with animations that replace the finger gestures (because the avatars haven't got fingers). What animations are available and which finger gestures they map to are listed on the pedestal.<br>Desktop users can trigger these animations by holding left shift or right shift and using F1-F8. Vive users can trigger the animations by swiping on the touchpad in the direction of the animation you wish to trigger, then holding the trigger to "lock" the animation. I do not know how Oculus or Windows Mixed Reality users trigger animations; sorry.<br>Note that you should only use one hand at a time to trigger these animations, or Unity will try to mix them together, leading to some horrifying faces. I do not recommend using two facial overrides at once.<br>These are hard to get a hold of, so I highly recommend practicing in the mirror.</span></div>

          <div class="waves-effect collapsible-header active"><i class="material-icons">bug_report</i>I've uploaded one of the box models, but the animations aren't working!</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body"><span>VRChat really doesn't appreciate avatars without fingers, and a lot of things break if your avatar doesn't have them, like the nubs on the box avatars. To fix this, in Blender, add invisible, non-weighted fingers at the end of the wrists, then set them in Unity. Problems solved (hopefully!)</span></div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="waves-effect collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">money_off</i>Can I buy these models?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body"><span>I didn't make these models, so they're not mine to sell or redistribute in any way. Because of this, I cannot send anyone the completed models, either for money or for free. See "Did you make these?" for where you can find the original models from their original creator to rig them up yourself.</span></div>

          <div class="waves-effect collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">contacts</i>I have a question or need help with rigging the box models, or otherwise need to speak with you outside of VRChat. Can I contact you?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Absolutely! I'm happy to help with any questions you may have regarding the box models, world building, or anything else that I can answer. Feel free to add me on Discord: <b>K-9#1205</b><br></span></div>

        <li>
          <div class="waves-effect collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">filter_drama</i>Why do you use these models?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body"><span>I stumbled across the models on twitter by chance, and rigged them up out of curiosity. What I didn't expect was how strong of a response they'd get. I've had people tell me that these models are their favorites, or that seeing them is the actual highlight of their day. Even if it's not everyone, some people get genuine happiness out of seeing these models, and the personality I try to put behind them. At the risk of sounding clich&eacute;, I'm not made of stone; if these characters can genuinely make someone's day a bit better, I'm happy to put as much energy and work as I can into making, using, and animating them, both in the technical sense and in the sense of personality.</span></div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="waves-effect collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">accessibility</i>Are you a guy?</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body"><span><img src="eeehh.gif" /><br>On a slightly more serious note, I don't think this matters all that much. The box models and the character and personality I try to put into them are separate from me (the person), so I don't think who I am in reality should influence the character.</span></div>
